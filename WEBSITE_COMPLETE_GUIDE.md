## Flagship Product - ArcadiaX

### Product Overview

**Product Name:** ArcadiaX  
**Tagline:** "Mixed Reality Drift Karting - Where Physical Thrills Meet Virtual Worlds"

**Core Concept:** ArcadiaX merges the excitement of drift karting with immersive mixed reality gaming, creating unforgettable social entertainment experiences.

### The Revolutionary Concept

**What Makes It Different:**

Unlike traditional VR where you're completely isolated in a virtual world, mixed reality lets players see:
- ✅ The real arena and physical space
- ✅ Their actual karts and wheels
- ✅ Other players in real-time
- ✅ PLUS virtual game elements overlaid perfectly in space

This creates a unique experience where:
- Players feel present in both worlds simultaneously
- Social interaction remains natural and fun
- Physical movement feels more intuitive
- The experience is more accessible (less motion sickness than VR)

**The Experience:**

Players wear Meta Quest 3 mixed reality headsets while driving physical drift karts in a real arena. They see the real arena, their actual karts, and other players - but also see virtual game elements like obstacles, power-ups, paint splatters, ghosts, and score indicators floating in the space around them.

It's not just racing - it's a complete party game platform with multiple game modes, each transforming the same physical space into entirely different gaming experiences.

ArcadiaX is a revolutionary social gaming platform that seamlessly blends 
the digital and physical worlds. Players wear Meta Quest 3 mixed reality 
headsets while driving physical drift karts in a real arena, experiencing 
virtual game elements overlaid onto their physical surroundings.

Unlike traditional VR where you're completely isolated, mixed reality lets 
players see the real arena, their actual karts, and other players - while 
also seeing virtual game elements like obstacles, power-ups, paint splatters, 
ghosts, and score indicators floating in the space around them.

It's not just racing - it's a complete party game platform with multiple 
game modes, each transforming the same physical space into entirely different 
gaming experiences.

**Step 01: Players Gear Up**
```

Heading: Players Gear Up

Description: Each player receives a Meta Quest 3 headset and gets seated in 
a custom drift kart equipped with integrated MR controls.

Details: Our custom karts feature smooth drifting capabilities, MR sensor 
integration, and safety features including emergency stops and speed limiters. 
The Meta Quest 3 provides crystal-clear mixed reality visuals with 
pass-through capabilities for perfect real-world integration.
```

**Step 02: Arena Anchoring**
```
Icon: 02
Heading: Arena Anchoring

Description: The system maps the physical arena (15×15m to 20×30m) and 
anchors virtual game elements precisely in the real space.

Details: Advanced spatial mapping technology creates a digital twin of your 
arena. Virtual elements stay perfectly aligned with the physical space, 
ensuring consistent gameplay and eliminating drift or misalignment issues.
```

**Step 03: Game Selection**
```
Icon: 03

entertainment. Perfect for group events where not everyone is playing.
```

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Mobile First Approach**
```
1. Design for mobile first (320px+)
2. Enhance for larger screens
3. Use Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
```

**Breakpoints**
```
Mobile: Default (< 640px)
• Single column layouts
• Stacked sections
• Hamburger menu
• Larger touch targets (min 44x44px)
• Simplified navigation

Tablet: sm: (640px+) and md: (768px+)
• Two-column where appropriate
• Expanded navigation
• More detailed content visible
• Balanced spacing

Desktop: lg: (1024px+) and xl: (1280px+)
• Full horizontal navigation
• Multi-column layouts
• Hover states active
• Maximum content width for readability (container mx-auto)
```

**Touch Optimization**
```
Mobile Specific:

• Increased spacing between clickable elements
• No hover-only functionality
• Swipe-friendly interfaces
• Bottom sheet patterns for modals
```
